# Shark Bot
Shark Bot is the official bot for the Swimmy Sharkies Discord server. It offers a variety of commands, and even the ability play chess. Type !commands for all available commands. This is the first version, so bugs are to be expected, especially with the chess playing feature, which has bugs in and of itself. Current version: v1.2

Current features: 
- Multiple command-and-responses using !
- Randomized shark pictures with !pics
- Chess playing

Planned features:
- Moving from ! commands to slash commands
- Improved chess playing
- Even more commands
- Rich presence

Known issues:
- Chess playing is very buggy due to the nature of the chess software itself
- Not online all the time
